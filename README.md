##Description: 
In this hands-on workshop, you will gain an understanding of how to use Hazelcast to build solutions that react to events in real-time. Participants will have the end-to-end experience of developing a solution on their laptop. We will cover the basic elements of a Pipeline: sources, sinks, map (variants such as usingService, usingIMap), aggregations, filters.

Participants will be guided through the development of a basic Pipeline that contains all of the essential elements of a stream processing solution, including sources, sinks, mappings, aggregations, and filters. Attendees will learn how to use Hazelcast, Kafka and SQL to process streaming data; enrich streaming data with data in fast storage; store output in fast storage.
